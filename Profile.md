# Professional Profile: Abhishek Mane 🚀
**Senior AI Solutions Architect | Multimodal Clinical Intelligence Specialist**

## 👔 Executive Summary
A visionary AI Engineer and Solutions Architect with a specialized focus on **Multimodal Healthcare Intelligence**. I build high-performance systems that bridge the gap between complex clinical data (Vision/Voice) and real-time medical decision support. My engineering philosophy revolves around **sub-millisecond inference**, **privacy-first data sovereignty**, and **extreme UI/UX precision**.

## 🛠️ Technical Domain Expertise

### 🧠 Artificial Intelligence & Neural Architectures
- **Large Vision Models (LVMs):** Expert-level implementation of Llama-3 Vision and Gemini 1.5 Pro/Flash for pixel-to-pathology mapping.
- **Multimodal Fusion:** Architecting "Fused Reasoning Circuits" that correlate disparate data streams (Radiology images + Physician dictation) at the point of inference.
- **Natural Language & Audio:** High-fidelity transcription using Whisper-v3 and expressive clinical synthesis via Edge-TTS.

### ⚡ High-Performance Computing
- **Hardware Acceleration:** Specialized logic optimization for **GROQ Linear Processor Units (LPUs)** to achieve sub-400ms end-to-end diagnostic latency.
- **Inference Optimization:** Tiered model orchestration and KV-cache management for real-time surgical support.

### 🏗️ Full-Stack & Systems Engineering
- **Backend:** FastAPI, Python, Asynchronous Logic, PostgreSQL.
- **Frontend:** React 19, TypeScript, Vite, 3D Visualization (Three.js/RTF), Microsoft Fluent Design.
- **Security & Compliance:** HIPAA-ready Sanitization Layers, AES-256 Zero-Knowledge encryption, and PHI/PII scrubbing protocols.
- **DevOps:** Docker-Compose orchestration, CI/CD pipeline automation, and Enterprise Node scaling.
